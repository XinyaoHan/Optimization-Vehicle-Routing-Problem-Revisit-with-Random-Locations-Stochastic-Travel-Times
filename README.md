# Optimization-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-Revisit-with-Random-Locations-Stochastic-Travel-Times

This is a project conducted by Qinwen Wang & Xinyao Han for MIT course 6.7201.  
Traditional routing problems only focus on which locations to deliver, but fail to incorporate time window. In this project we optimized delivery routes with random customer locations & stochastic travel times, reducing delivery cost by 60%.
